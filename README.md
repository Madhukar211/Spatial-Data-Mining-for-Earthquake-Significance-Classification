# Spatial-Data-Mining-for-Earthquake-Significance-Classification
(A) Dataset:
The dataset provides information about earthquake events which consists of various attributes. These attributes include the timestamp (`time`) of each earthquake, its geographical coordinates in terms of latitude and longitude (`latitude` and `longitude`), and the depth (`depth`) at which the earthquake originated. The dataset also records the earthquake's magnitude (`mag`) and the type of magnitude measurement method employed (`magType`). Information about the seismic monitoring network, the number of reporting seismometer stations (`nst`), the gap between these reporting stations (`gap`), and the closest distance to a reporting station (`dmin`) is also available. Additionally, the dataset contains details about the signal quality represented as the root mean square (`rms`). Each earthquake event is uniquely identified by an `id`. The dataset provides location descriptions (`place`) and categorizes earthquake events by type (`type`). Geospatial accuracy is accounted for with attributes such as horizontal error (`horizontalError`), depth error (`depthError`), and magnitude error (`magError`). The dataset also captures the number of stations contributing to magnitude information (`magNst`). The reporting status of each earthquake event (`status`) and the sources of location (`locationSource`) and magnitude information (`magSource`) are included. This dataset enables in-depth analysis and modeling of earthquake events with a wide range of attributes and information sources.
(B) Problem Statement:
To classify earthquakes into two categories: "significant" and "not significant." The significance is determined based on the magnitude (`mag`) of the earthquake. Earthquakes with a magnitude greater than or equal to 5.0 are considered "significant," while those below 5.0 are labeled as "not significant."
